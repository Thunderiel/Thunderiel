1. Basic Networking Concepts
OSI Model: Explain the 7 layers and their functions. The Osi (open systems interconnections) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a networking or telecommunication system into seven layers: physical data link network,trransport session, presentation and application. understanding this helps diagnose and troubleshoot networks.
TCP/IP Model: Describe how it relates to the OSI model. The Trransmission control protocol/internet protocol model is more practical, four layer model used to describe how data is transmitted over a network. crucial for understanding how the internet works.
IP Addressing: Differentiate between IPv4 and IPv6, and explain subnetting. IP addresses are unique identifiers for devices on a network. a subnet mask is used to determine which portion of ip address is thee network part and which is the host part. For example IP 192.168.1.1 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0 the first 3 octets 192.168.1 are network portion, the last octet 1 is the host portion.
Common Protocols: HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SSH, DNS, and their uses.
2. Linux Fundamentals
File System Navigation: Commands like ls, cd, pwd.
File Permissions: Understanding chmod, chown, and file permission types.
Basic Commands: grep, find, tar, scp, rsync.
Process Management: Using ps, top, kill, and jobs.
3. Security Concepts
CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
Encryption Basics: Symmetric vs. Asymmetric encryption, common algorithms (AES, RSA).
Hashing: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and their purposes.
Firewall Basics: What a firewall is, types (network vs. host-based), and common firewall rules.
4. Threats and Vulnerabilities
Types of Malware: Viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware.
Common Vulnerabilities: SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Buffer Overflow.
Social Engineering: Phishing, pretexting, baiting, and ways to prevent them.
Zero-Day Exploits: What they are and why they’re dangerous.
5. Cybersecurity Tools
Wireshark: Basic packet capture and analysis.
nmap: Network scanning, basic commands, and common use cases.
Metasploit: Basics of using this framework for penetration testing.
Burp Suite: Introduction to web vulnerability scanning.
6. Incident Response
Incident Response Lifecycle: Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned.
Basic Forensics: Data collection, chain of custody, and analysis tools like Autopsy or Volatility.
Log Analysis: What to look for in system logs, common log sources (e.g., Syslog, Windows Event Logs).
7. Compliance and Standards
Common Frameworks: NIST, ISO/IEC 27001, CIS Controls.
GDPR: Basics of the General Data Protection Regulation.
HIPAA: Key points for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
PCI-DSS: Overview of Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.
8. Penetration Testing
Penetration Testing Phases: Reconnaissance, Scanning, Exploitation, Post-Exploitation, Reporting.
Kali Linux: Overview of this Linux distribution and its purpose in pentesting.
Common Tools: Overview of tools like Nikto, Hydra, John the Ripper.
Writing Reports: Basics of documenting findings, risk assessment, and recommendations.
9. Cloud Security
Cloud Service Models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS – definitions and examples.
Shared Responsibility Model: Understanding what the cloud provider vs. customer is responsible for.
Common Cloud Security Risks: Misconfigurations, data breaches, insider threats.
Identity and Access Management (IAM): Basics of IAM in cloud environments.
10. Ethical Hacking
Legal and Ethical Guidelines: Understanding the legal aspects and ethics of hacking.
Bug Bounty Programs: What they are and how to get involved.
Responsible Disclosure: How to report vulnerabilities ethically.
